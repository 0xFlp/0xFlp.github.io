Hi! I'm **Felipe**, a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong interest in **PWN**. I actively participate in **CTFs** and enjoy solving challenging security problems.  

I love exploring binary exploitation, reverse engineering, and anything related to offensive security. When I'm not hacking CTF challenges, I spend time learning new techniques.
